The way he achieves this is by participating in numerous projects that each have a small and focused team. He genuinely believes that this is the best way to share what each person knows through active collaboration, without the need for pen and paper, but with meaningful discussions and common purposes. Some of the teams that he joined worked on various fields of engineering, such as robotics, and web technologies; all of which he has fortunately met people who taught and gave him valuable insights. These are also the people who motivate him to be better everyday than the day before.","At the Healthy Cities laboratory, Sean assists its members to the best extent of his capability, which includes building a website to better promote what the lab does, as well as helping conduct experiments to understand how a person’s thermal and respiratory comfort is affected by wearing a mask.
