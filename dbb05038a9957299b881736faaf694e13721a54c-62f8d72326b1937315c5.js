His current main research interests include micro-environment in facial masks and thermal comfort. Before this role, he received his Master\'s degree in Building and Civil Engineering in 2019, from Chongqing University, focusing on building energy efficiency and urban thermal environment, including monitoring, modelling, and simulation. From 2017 to 2018, he devised and carried out the exposure trails of 12 roofing products in Chengdu and Xiamen, studied the impact of natural aging on energy savings of high reflective flat roofs. In 2016, he joined the US/China joint research project ‘Experiment study of energy use comparison of the cool roof & green roof in office building’ facilitated by Chongqing University and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Additionally, he obtained his bachelor\'s degree in Building Environment and Facility Engineering in 2016, from Jiangsu University of Science and technology. In the past 7 years, he has published 8 SCI articles, got 5 patents, and numerous prizes, including 3 national-level prizes and the third prize of Jiangsu province, and he gained the China National Postgraduate Scholarship twice."],"affiliationPeriodStart":"2020-06-30T16:00:00.000Z","affiliationPeriodEnd":"2025-06-30T10:00:00.000Z","cv":"https://sjyurbanlab.github.io/website-assets/members/dachuanshi/cv.pdf"},"2":{"avatar":"https://sjyurbanlab.github.io/website-assets/members/xinjiehuang/profile.jpg","firstName":"Xinjie","lastName":"Huang","position":"MPhil Student","email":"xjmhuang@connect.hku.hk","introduction":["Xinjie joined Healthy Cities Lab as an MPhil student at HKU in Fall 2020.

The way he achieves this is by participating in numerous projects that each have a small and focused team. He genuinely believes that this is the best way to share what each person knows through active collaboration, without the need for pen and paper, but with meaningful discussions and common purposes. Some of the teams that he joined worked on various fields of engineering, such as robotics, and web technologies; all of which he has fortunately met people who taught and gave him valuable insights. These are also the people who motivate him to be better everyday than the day before.","At the Healthy Cities laboratory, Sean assists its members to the best extent of his capability, which includes building a website to better promote what the lab does, as well as helping conduct experiments to understand how a person’s thermal and respiratory comfort is affected by wearing a mask.
