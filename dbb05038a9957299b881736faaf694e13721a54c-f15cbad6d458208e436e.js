He obtained his B.Eng. degree in Building Environment and Energy Engineering at Southeast University in China. He is interested in microclimate, air quality, ventilation, and thermal comfort on both indoor and urban scales. Before he joined Healthy Cities Lab, he has performed several research projects on air quality, especially on indoor-outdoor air exchanges. He has also won the national first prize as team leader in the National University Student Competition on Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction. His research will focus on mechanisms and applications of vegetation-air interactions in the built environment. Apart from academic interests, Xinjie is also keen on Cantonese music and feels passionate to work in Hong Kong, which is such a metropolitan city and a unique field laboratory to study urban climate and air quality."],"affiliationPeriodStart":"2020-08-31T16:00:00.000Z","affiliationPeriodEnd":"2022-08-31T10:00:00.000Z","cv":"https://sjyurbanlab.github.io/website-assets/members/xinjiehuang/cv.pdf"},"2":{"avatar":"https://sjyurbanlab.github.io/website-assets/members/qilongzhong/profile.jpg","firstName":"Qilong","lastName":"Zhong","position":"PhD Student","email":"u3008374@connect.hku.hk","introduction":["Qilong became a Healthy Cities Lab member as a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) since Sept. 2021.

The way he achieves this is by participating in numerous projects that each have a small and focused team. He genuinely believes that this is the best way to share what each person knows through active collaboration, without the need for pen and paper, but with meaningful discussions and common purposes. Some of the teams that he joined worked on various fields of engineering, such as robotics, and web technologies; all of which he has fortunately met people who taught and gave him valuable insights. These are also the people who motivate him to be better everyday than the day before.","At the Healthy Cities laboratory, Sean assists its members to the best extent of his capability, which includes building a website to better promote what the lab does, as well as helping conduct experiments to understand how a person’s thermal and respiratory comfort is affected by wearing a mask.
